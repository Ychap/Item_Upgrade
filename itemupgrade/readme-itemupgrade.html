        <p>The Item Upgrade Mod Pack allows Cromwell and Cespenar to upgrade more
          items for you. Half of them are conveniences, the other half try to prop up
          weapon categories that are &quot;weak&quot; by comparison (e.g., maces and clubs).</p>

      <p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pocket-Plane-Group/Item_Upgrade/master/itemupgrade/docs/readme-itemupgrades.txt">The last text readme</a> from v51 is available in the docs folder. </p>

      <p>Item Upgrade is available for Baldur's Gate II, the original or Enhanced Edition, and the conversion projects BGT and EET. Item Upgrade is a fairly stand-alone mod
        and as such has no known compatibility issues. </p>
      <p>In terms of install order, because it doesn't interact much with other mods, it can go fairly early in the installation order. </p>
      <p>As of v33, Cromwell and Cespenar dialogues no longer replace critical states,
        making it much easier for other mods to interact with IU. In v42 Cespenar audio was folded into the main mod and is no longer available separately. </p>

      <p>First time installing a mod? Check out G3's comprehensive tutorial: <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/33164-a-new-player&rsquo;s-guide-to-installing-and-playing-mods/">A
        New Player&rsquo;s Guide to Installing and Playing Mods</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Enhanced Editions Note</strong><br />
        The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every   patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a   modded game you might want to delay the
        patch update (if possible) as   even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with   your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a   new one
        that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language   version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the
        mod   will not show but give error messages. </p>
      <p><strong>Windows</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for Windows is distributed as a self-extracting archive and includes a WeiDU installer. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, the files can be extracted into your game directory using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a> or <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>.
        When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-itemupgrade.exe</strong> and the folder<strong> itemupgrade</strong>. To install,
        double-click <strong>setup-itemupgrade.exe</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-itemupgrade.exe</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>MacOS</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for macOS is distributed as a compressed tarball and includes a WeiDU installer.</p>
      <p>First, extract the files from the tarball into your game directory. When properly extracted, your game directory will contain <strong>setup-itemupgrade</strong>, <strong>setup-itemupgrade.command</strong>, and the folder<strong> itemupgrade</strong>. To install, double-click <strong>setup-itemupgrade.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
      <p>You can run <strong>setup-itemupgrade.command</strong> in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong><br />
        Item Upgrade for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer. Linux users will need to do a one-time install of <abbr title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</abbr> (and a few other adjustments) as described in <a href="https://moebiusproject.gitlab.io/mods_on_linux" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this great writeup</a>. </p>
      <p>To install, run 'WeInstall itemupgrade' in your game folder. </p>
      <p><strong> Note for Complete Uninstallation</strong><br />
        In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely uninstall the mod using setup-itemupgrade --uninstall at the command line to
        remove all components without wading through prompts.</p>

      <p>You will have the opportunity to install the SoA and ToB upgrades separately.
        Each will have two options as well: the ability for the upgrades to be presented
        in a long list for convenience (the original) and a second option for the
        upgrades to be in the normal 'rummaging' process so that they don't stand out as
        modded content.</p>
      <p>You do *not* need to start a new game to take advantage of anything you
        installed.</p>
      <p>As of v42, Jason Compton's Cespenar audio is available in the main mod for
        English-speaking players instead of a separate download. From the original
        Cespenar Audio readme:</p>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p> I enjoyed writing many of the lines you see for Cespenar in Westley
          Weimer's Item Upgrade mod. So I decided to have even more fun and breathe
          life into those lines with my best crack at a voice for our favorite imp
          butler.</p>
        <p>So, here it is. All 44 &quot;intro&quot; lines to the items that can be upgraded, as
          of IU v42, are here.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_rectangle_h3">
      <h3>Items</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-l"></div>
    <div class="ribbon_triangle_h2-r"></div>
    <div class="section">
      <p> The items are listed here with the components on the left and the result on
        the right. For example, the first group means that you can forge a Ring of
        Protection +1, a Ring of Regeneration, a Diamond and 10,000 gold into a Ring
        of Preservation +1.</p>
      <p>This mod also fixes Carsomyr +5 and Carsomyr +6 so that they use the same
        &quot;dispel magic&quot; opcode as the Staff of the Magi. That is, they will
        actually dispel things. They also increase MR by 50% rather than setting
        it to 50%. In addition, the Mace of Disruption +2 now uses the MoD+1 icon.</p>
      <p>WARNING! Do not use ShadowKeeper, EEKeeper, the console, etc. to give yourself the components for an
        upgrade and then complain that Cromwell and Cespy won't let you do the
        upgrade. ShadowKeeper will often list multiple entries for an item (e.g.,
        there are two &quot;Pearl&quot;s and two &quot;Wand of Lightning&quot;s in ShadowKeeper's item
        list) -- but only one of them is really found in the game and only one of
        them will work with the Item Upgrade mod. If you give yourself the wrong
        one (and it is easy to do since they have the same name) you won't be able
        to do the upgrade.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why can't I talk to Lilarcor?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Lilarcor +5 is controlled by the mind flayer circlet and thus prevented
        from having complete conversations. He will still banter with you (e.g.,
        &quot;Booring!&quot; or &quot;Throw a coin in that fountain!&quot;) while you're standing
        around. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Does the Ring of Elemental Mastery include the &quot;hidden&quot; +1 saves
        bonus from the Ring of Earth Control?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. The &quot;hidden&quot; +1 saves bonus in the Earth Control ring may or may
        not be a bug in BG2, but by a large margin users voted to keep the +1
        bonus in the RoEM regardless. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do I get that many demon hearts?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> There are three in the Mage Stronghold Quest (the Planar Sphere) and you
        only need to give one back to the Sphere to get out. That leaves you with
        two spares. You may also use the demon hearts from the maze level of the
        Watcher's Keep. That will leave you with 0 to 2 spares. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I get a cursed potion of healing?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> Nearly every merchant in Athkatla sells the things. Look for the bottle
        labeled &quot;Potion of Healing&quot; that isn't blue. The description usually says
        something about it being &quot;oddly murky&quot;. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the stats for the original Kitthix?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> 44 HP, Base AC 4, Attacks 3/2, Saves 12/14/13/14/14, 10% MR, 2 Hit Dice,
        14 STR, 9 Other Stats. Attack: +0 weapon, 1d8 piercing, save vs. poison at
        +1 or take 3 hp per second for 14 seconds. Immune to Web. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the stats for the Improved Kitthix?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> 80 HP, Base AC -2, 4 Attacks, Saves 6, 25% MR, 10 Hit Dice, 18 DEX.
        Attack: +3 weapon, 2d4 piercing, save vs. poison at -3 or take 5 hp per
        second for 12 seconds, save vs. spells at -2 or be webbed for 7 seconds.
        Immunity to Web, 50% melee damage resistance. Regenerates. </p>
      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where is Water's Edge?</p>
      <p><strong>A:</strong> It belongs to a noble drow in the city of Ust Natha. Do all of the
        side-quests there.</p>

        <li>Resolved compatibility issue with the SCS component &quot;Make spell
          sequencers, spell triggers, and contingencies learnable by all mages&quot;.
          If installed, it removes all scrolls of Contingency from the game. In
          that case, you will need a scroll of Globe of Invulnerability instead
          of Contingency for the archmagi robe formulas. However, this requires
          SCS of version &gt; v32.8. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 44 - February 14, 2019 [CamDawg]</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug where the Incarnadine Elven Chain upgrade asked for three
          fire agate gems, but actually checked and used Dispel Magic scrolls. </li>
        <li>Updated the Sorcerian Ring to account for the alternate Rings of
          Wizardry (aka Reaching Ring) in EE/newer Fixpack games. </li>
        <li>Lowercased all sound references in dialogue to fix audio issues on
          case-sensitive file systems. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 43 - December 9, 2017 [CamDawg]</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Polish translation should no longer crash EE games, for real this time </li>
        <li>argent77 had made a macro to help EE-ify item descriptions from
          vanilla item descriptions; this is now used for the Korean and Russian
          translations since they lack a dedicated, EE-specific translation </li>
        <li>NPC-restricted items will now use the same restriction schemes as
          their parent items for EE games </li>
        <li>Fixed a bug where the some install options were not available for
          Polish players </li>
        <li>Items which provide immunity to poison now also block Cloudkill </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 42 - June 18, 2017 [CamDawg]</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The mod now accounts for EET games </li>
        <li>v41 was using an outdated version of the Polish translation (Cam's
          fault) which was causing text issues (at best) or crashes (at worst)
          for Polish players </li>
        <li>Cam was also using an older French translation. </li>
        <li>The Cespenar audio, previously available as a separate download, is
          now integrated into the mainline mod. The audio is English-only. </li>
        <li>The English item descriptions for EE games have been revised to better
          fit in with the EE style </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 41 - June 5, 2017 [CamDawg]</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added French translation - thanks to Sanctifer, of the d'Oghmatiques </li>
        <li>Added EE-specific Polish translation - thanks to Cahir </li>
        <li>Character sets will now be converted as appropriate for EE games </li>
        <li>Suppressed 'Revised versions' options for languages that do not have
          the translation </li>
        <li>Amulet of Ilmater was incorrectly providing immunity from disease
          damage </li>
        <li>Corrected weight of Teleomortis, Quietus, Citadel Helmet, and Tower of
          Iron Will </li>
        <li>Corrected speed factor of Inevitable Entropy and Daystar +4 </li>
        <li>Creatures of 4 HD or less were not getting a save chance against
          Creeping Chaos' confusion effect </li>
        <li>Tower of Iron Will and Shield of Harmony +3 were missing a handful of
          psionic protections </li>
        <li>Free action effect on the Improved Firecam Full-Plate Armor and the
          Sword of Arvoreen +5 needed some touchups </li>
        <li>Improved Human Flesh was not protecting its wearer from poison </li>
        <li>The Bag of Plenty +3 was providing +4 to-hit </li>
        <li>Celestial Fury +5's stun effect now provides combat feedback </li>
        <li>Fixed power levels on Water's Talon +4 </li>
        <li>Ring of Wizardry upgrade now accounts for the alternate introduced by
          EE/BG2 Fixpack v11 </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 40 - July 31, 2013 [CamDawg]</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Items were run through the immunity effect batch fixes from the BG2
          Fixpack since most provided incomplete protections: Amulet of Ilmater,
          Tower of Iron Will, Citadel Helmet, Improved Firecam Plate, Sword of
          Arvoreen, Shield of Harmony, Throwing Unicorn Spear, Corthala Family
          Armor, Lilarcor, and Water's Talon </li>
        <li>Delryn Family Shield now casts PFNM directly so that it'll keep up
          with compatibility, i.e. new projectiles from 1PP and elsewhere </li>
        <li>Azuredge copied over the same bug as the original Azuredge in that its
          'Undead Destroyed' message would never be seen due to effect
          misordering </li>
        <li>Closed exploit where Daystar, Azuredge and Skullcrusher's specific
          bonuses would apply to the other equipped weapon if dual-wielded. This
          also addresses a bug where these items would hurt the wielder when
          equipped if the BG2 Fixpack was installed </li>
        <li>Daystar's damage was incorrect vs. evil undead </li>
        <li>Blizzard Boots were using the Resist Fire/Cold portrait icon instead
          of Protection from Cold </li>
        <li>Redundant AC bonus from Gloves of the Master Thief removed </li>
        <li>Quietus could cause blindness AND sleep on 1% of hits </li>
        <li>Elves and half-elves will now have their regular sleep/charm immunity
          from the upgraded items if BG2 Fixpack is installed </li>
        <li>Improved Kitthix's web and poison attacks had an incorrect duration </li>
        <li>Ring of Elemental Control now casts Improved Invisibility directly
          instead of simulating it (compatibility); the charm effect is now
          limited to elementals </li>
        <li>The Ring of Wizardry and the Sorcerian Ring can no longer be worn
          concurrently (Wes had coded this, but left a loophole open) </li>
        <li>Shield of Harmony had the wrong AC vs. missile attacks </li>
        <li>All of the upgraded spears had the wrong range, wrong attack animation
          mix, and were doing pure piercing damage when thrown instead of the
          proper missile/piercing </li>
        <li>The charm animal ability of the Staff of the Woodlands was causing
          spurious save messages </li>
        <li>Power levels on the upgraded Celestial Fury are now correct </li>
        <li>Improved Human Flesh had a spurious move silently bonus </li>
        <li>The dispel-on-hit abilities of the Hallowed Redeemer and Unholy Reaver
          weren't fully dispelling all effects </li>
        <li>The branches for the Shield of Harmony update (in the compatibility
          version of both components) were reversed, preventing upgrades when
          you had all components and allowing them with only the shield </li>
        <li>All upgrades now account for the 'alternate' versions of items created
          by the PnP Protection Items and Two-Handed Katana components of BG2
          Tweaks (now known as Tweaks Anthology) </li>
        <li>All items now have relevant tooltip entries for their abilities </li>
        <li>The new magical armor and protection items can no longer be worn
          together </li>
        <li>The item icon for Teleomortis had a pink shadow when moved </li>
        <li>The Bag of Plenty icon was not transparent when in inventory </li>
        <li>The existing Quiver of Plenty now uses the restored icon found by
          Unfinished Business; the upgraded version now uses a variant of the
          restored icon </li>
        <li>Quiver of Plenty, Case of Plenty, and Bag of Plenty upgrades were
          allowing use without non-proficiency penalties </li>
        <li>Quiver of Plenty and Case of Plenty now use the correct ground icons </li>
        <li>The Enhanced Robes of the Archmagi now provide magic resistance
          portrait icons </li>
        <li>The SoA and ToB components are now wholly independent </li>
        <li>Other minor fixes, such as a few items with incorrect weights or
          usability flags </li>
        <li>Minor description fixes, such as multiple THACO &gt; THAC0 typos </li>
        <li>Future-proofed descriptions for BG2EE </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Fixed broken index for c2staf01.itm. On OS X, a bad index causes
          BG2 to crash to desktop. Additionally, the indexing error can
          cause other mod installations (i.e. Quest Pack) to fail. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Version 33 [CamDawg]:</strong></p>
      <ul>

          via patch instead of overwrite </li>
        <li>Lilarcor +5, like the original, was permanently setting an
          immunity to the confusion animation instead of simply preventing
          it while equipped. The original Lilarcor is fixed by the BG2
          Fixpack. </li>
        <li>Several items had minor effects (such as a color set) failing due
          to incorrect timings and magic resistance checks </li>

        <li>Fixed a possible bug in Chaos that was causing it to not confuse
